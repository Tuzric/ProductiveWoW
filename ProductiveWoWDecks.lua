-- IMPORTANT NOTE: Double check you closed off all the brackets (both curly and square) and that you added all the commas and quotes properly.
-- if the addon doesn't load, it's because you messed up something here

-- List additional cards to add to decks. This only adds additional cards, it does not define the comprehensive list 
-- of cards in a deck.

-- If you delete a card in this list through the in-game UI, it will reappear when you /reload or login again because it gets re-added
-- due to being in this list.

-- RECOMMENDATION: To avoid the above issue, login once to load the cards you want to bulk add/delete, then come back to this file
-- and delete them from here so that you can edit/delete these cards through the UI without your changes being reset upon the next login
